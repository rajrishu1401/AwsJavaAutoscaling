Auto-Scaling Web Application Deployment on EC2 

Overview :

    This project demonstrates the deployment of a web application with auto-scaling capabilities on Amazon EC2. The deployment is fully automated and ensures high availability by scaling EC2 instances based on       the load. The project utilizes various AWS services including EC2, IAM, S3, EBS, and Lambda, to build a robust and scalable infrastructure. The setup involves configuring IAM roles, updating a user data          script, and running the main deployment file. 

Features :

    Auto-Scaling: Automatically scales EC2 instances based on traffic load. 
    
    Web Application Hosting: Deploys a web application on EC2 instances. 
    
    Elastic Load Balancing: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances. 
    
    IAM Configuration: Manages secure access to AWS resources. 
    
    EBS Storage: Uses Elastic Block Storage for persistent data storage. 
    
    Lambda Functions: Leverages AWS Lambda for serverless tasks supporting auto-scaling. 

Technologies Used: 

    Amazon EC2: For hosting web application instances. 
    
    Amazon S3: For static web content and backups. 
    
    Amazon EBS: For persistent storage attached to EC2 instances. 
    
    AWS IAM: For managing secure access control. 
    
    Elastic Load Balancer (ELB): For distributing incoming traffic. 
    
    AWS Lambda: For serverless operations. 
    
    Amazon CloudWatch: For monitoring and triggering scaling events. 

Prerequisites :

    AWS Account: You must have an active AWS account. 
    
    AWS CLI: Install AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) on your system. AWS CLI Installation Guide. 
    
    IAM Role for EC2: You need to configure an IAM role for your EC2 instances. This will be done through a script that grants the necessary permissions. 
    
Setup Instructions :

  Step 1: Configure AWS CLI :

    Open your terminal or command prompt. 
    
    Run the following command to configure your AWS CLI with the necessary credentials: 
    
    aws configure 
  
    Enter your AWS Access Key, Secret Access Key, Region, and Output format when prompted. 

  Step 2: Run the IAMRoleForEC2 Script :

    Run the IAMRoleForEC2 script to create an IAM role for your EC2 instances. This role will allow EC2 instances to interact with other AWS services, such as S3, CloudWatch, and Lambda. 
    
    Ensure that the script is configured with the appropriate permissions for your environment. 
    
    After running the script, verify that the IAM role has been created in the AWS IAM console. 

  Step 3: Modify the User Data Script in LaunchTemplateManager 

    Navigate to the LaunchTemplateManager file in the project. 
    
    Open the file and locate the User Data Script section. 
    
    Modify the script according to your applicationâ€™s needs, such as setting up the necessary environment for your web application, installing dependencies, or configuring services. 
    
    Example: You may need to configure your web server, database connections, or application settings in the user data script. 

  Step 4: Run the Main Deployment Script 

    Once the IAM role is set up and the user data script is updated, run the main deployment script to automatically configure EC2 instances, set up load balancing, and enable auto-scaling. 
    
    The main script will: 
    
    Launch EC2 instances based on your specified configurations. 
    
    Configure Elastic Load Balancer to distribute traffic evenly across the instances. 
    
    Create an Auto Scaling group to automatically adjust the number of EC2 instances as needed. 
    
    Attach the IAM role to EC2 instances. 
    
    Set up EBS volumes for persistent storage. 
    
    Configure Lambda functions for serverless tasks (if applicable). 

  Step 5: Monitor and Adjust 

    Use AWS CloudWatch to monitor the performance and resource utilization of your instances. 

If necessary, modify auto-scaling policies or instance configurations to optimize performance and cost. 

Future Enhancements 

CI/CD Integration: Set up a continuous integration and continuous deployment pipeline to automate future deployments. 

Backup Strategy: Implement an automatic backup system using AWS S3 and Lambda. 

Cost Optimization: Refine the auto-scaling policies to minimize costs without compromising on performance.
